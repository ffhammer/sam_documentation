# Stress Addition Model (SAM)


This is a Python reimplementation of the Stress Addition Model (SAM) from the research paper "Predicting the synergy of multiple stress effects" by Matthias Liess, Kaarina Foit, Saskia Knillmann, Ralf B. Schäfer, and Hans-Dieter Liess.

## Impact of Additional Stress on Lethal Concentrations (LCs)


This section demonstrates how lethal concentrations (LCs) increase with added stress across different dose-response curves. The following graphics illustrate various aspects of this impact:

- **[LC10 and LC50 Increases with Additional Stress](imgs/increase_in_lcs/different_curves.html)**  
  This graphic shows, for each dose-response curve in our dataset, how LC10 (left) and LC50 (right) values increase in response to additional stress, as predicted by our SAM Model.

- **[Observed vs. SAM-Predicted LC Increases](imgs/increase_in_lcs/lcs.html)**  
  This graphic compares observed (blue) and SAM-predicted (green) increases in lethal concentrations (LCs) for all data samples subjected to additional stress.

## Visualizing Dose-Response Fits Across Experiments

This section visualizes dose-response fits across all experiments. Each curve is projected into a "normalized" scale, where lethal concentrations (LCs) range from LC1 to LC99, enabling effective comparisons between experiments.

- **[Raw Dose-Response Curves](imgs/dose_response_curves/raw_dosecurves.html)**  
  This visualization shows the unprocessed dose-response fits for each experiment, as generated by the `sam.dose_response_fit` method, without any adjustments.

- **[Cleaned Dose-Response Curves](imgs/dose_response_curves/cleaned_dosecurves.html)**  
  This visualization shows "cleaned" dose-response curves, where system-inherent stress effects have been removed. Subhormesis points are dropped, and the control survival rate is set to 100%, providing a clearer view of the dose-response relationship in isolation.

## Experiments

The following is a list of individual experiments conducted, each with detailed data and SAM model predictions:

{% for experiment in experiments %}
- [{{ experiment }}](experiments/{{ experiment }})
{% endfor %}
