# SAM - Stress Addition Model

SAM is a Python reimplementation of the Stress Addition Model from the paper "[Predicting the synergy of multiple stress effects](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep32965)" by Liess et al. It follows the methodology from [Systemecology](https://www.systemecology.de/indicate/) and achieves nearly identical results across diverse datasets.

We also reimplemented the [$EC_{x-\text{sys}}$ model](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-51645-4) from Liess et al. (2019) as `sam.ecxsys`. This package lets you predict, visualize, and save outcomes for both SAM and EC$_{x-\text{sys}}$, even with minimal Python experience.

Examples:  
- `examples/sam.py`  
- `examples/ec_x-SyS.py`

## Install
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/mockaWolke/sam.git
```

## Dataset and Publication

This repository is under active development for an upcoming publication. The `data` folder contains collated datasets on the effects of multiple stressors. More details will be available on our publication website: [SAM Publication](https://ffhamer.github.io/sam/).

## Detailed Documentation

Further documentation—including experimental setups and dataset handling—is available at: [SAM Documentation](https://ffhamer.github.io/sam_documentation/).
